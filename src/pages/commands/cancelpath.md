# Cancelpath Command

This is a short one - the command does no more than the name says :D
It cancels the currently active path of a player.

<CmdLine>
  /cancelpath
</CmdLine>

<br>

::: tip
If the command doesn't appear in your game it means that you have no active path.
The command gets enabled everytime you start a path visualization and disabled once you cancelled or completed it.
